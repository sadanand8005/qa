This is a plugin for Question2Answer and provides a page
displaying all "open" questions (questions without answer

excludes all closed questions. This plugin shows the
questions that need to be answered by someone - unanswered
and not closed. RSS for the open questions is not implemented.

2) Extract it into "q2a-open-questions" folder under the
   "qa-plugin" folder of your Question2Answer installation
   
3) Enable the plugin through the Question2Answer's Admin panel:
